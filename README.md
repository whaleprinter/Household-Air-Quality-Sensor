# Household-Air-Quality-Sensor
A little side project I'm working on to develop a low-cost air quality sensor for the house. The long-term goal here is to analyze the data that this thing collects and use it to reduce heating/cooling costs at home. I'll also put the CAD files and wiring diagrams here as needed.
